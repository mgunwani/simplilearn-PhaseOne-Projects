Prototype in JavaScript:

    As, JavaScript is a dynamic or loosely-typed scripting language.
    We can attach new propertie and methods to an object at any time.

    The Prototype is an object that is associated with every function and
    object by default in JavaScript. We can add properties and methods directly
    to them rather than adding them to instance.
